# Digital First Architecture Principles

<!--toc max2-->


## Introduction

This document can be used by architects within the Scottish public sector to support the delivery of Digital First transactional services for citizens and businesses. In addition this document can be used by customers and prospective customers of mygov.scot services to understand the principles used when delivering these services.

### What is Digital First?

Digital First is a service standard that describes the minimum requirements when delivering a citizen-facing, online service, that will be provided via [mygov.scot](https://www.mygov.scot/). The document is based upon GDS' "Digital by Default" standard.

### What is mygov.scot?

[mygov.scot](https://www.mygov.scot) is the place for people in Scotland to access public services that are easy to find and simple to use. Our approach is to work closely and in partnership with public sector organisations to put user needs at the forefront of service delivery and design.

### Relationship to the High Level Operating Framework

These architecture principles are complementary to those found in the [Scottish Government High Level Operating Framework](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Economy/digital/digitalservices/HLOF) (HLOF). These principles focus on the delivery of specific transactional services where as those in the HLOF focus on the delivery of the organisation as a whole.

### Format of this document

This document is structured as a series of architecure principles. The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) descrobes [architecture principles](http://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap23.html) as follows:

> Principles are general rules and guidelines, intended to be enduring and seldom amended, that inform and support the way in which an organization sets about fulfilling its mission.

We broadly follow the TOGAF definition in this document and, in particular, we follow the `name/statement/rationale/implications` structure for each principle.

### Assessment

We are currently establishing an assessment approach that will sit along side the Digital First Service Standard in order to support organisations who implement services against the standard. We have shared some of [our initial thoughts on the assessment process](http://blogs.scotland.gov.uk/digital/2016/05/12/putting-people-at-the-heart-of-digital-public-services/) and will provide further updates on the [Digital Scotland blog](http://blogs.scotland.gov.uk/digital/) in the future.
