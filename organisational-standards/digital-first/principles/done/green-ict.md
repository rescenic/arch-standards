## Green ICT

A cost effective and energy efficient ICT estate that reduces the environmental impact and continually looks for more sustainable ways of working for the public sector.

### Rationale

- ICT infrastructure will be deployed in an energy-efficient manner and, by delivering services digitally, reduce our carbon footprint;
- The way in which we deploy and manage our ICT operations should minimise its effect on the environment both in terms of energy usage and emissions.

### Implications

- Actively consider opportunities to work with other organisations to aggregate demand and/or re-use existing services;
- Complete a baseline maturity assessment against the Scottish Government's Green ICT maturity model and establish a plan to increase Green ICT maturity;
- For each procurement undertaken to deliver the service consider how in conducting the procurement process improvements can be made in terms of Green ICT and environmental well-being; (TODO: investigate "sustainable procurement duty" of The Procurement Reform Act as discussed in Green ICT policy)
    - where possible procure services not assets;
    - high weight green credentials in the awarding of contracts;
    - compare repair, refurbishment and recycling of existing systems against replacement of a system;
- Review the operation of online services to increase efficiencies and reduce consumption;
- plan for the disposal of equipment prior to its acquisition:
    - Review the WEEE regulations and Scotland's Zero Waste Plan;
    - Consider opportunities to sell or to donate equipment;
    - Develop re-use and recycling policy;
- Provide appropriate training to ensure that staff consider environmental implications in their day-to-day work.
