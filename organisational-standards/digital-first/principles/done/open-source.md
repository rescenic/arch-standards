## Open source

Make all new source code open and reusable, and publish it under appropriate licenses (or give a convincing explanation as to why this can’t be done for specific subsets of the source code).

### Rationale

Benefits of using Open Source software include:

- *Simpler collaboration* – For several Scottish public sector organisations to work collaboratively on a shared service or solution there must be clear agreement on, and understanding of, how intellectual property rights will be managed. Open source licensing resolves this issue ensuring that an acceptable, well understood set of rights are conferred to all parties;
- *Value for money* – a charge is not typically applied to license open source software so solutions, applications or libraries created by a Scottish public sector body may be easily re-used by other bodies under an open source license; This will lead to a reduction in the total cost of ownership for IT solutions
- *Transparency* – open source licenses typically confer to users the right to study the source code for the solution. This simplifies any necessary audit that must take place for a system in order to guarantee that the solution is free from security vulnerabilities, back-doors, tracking capabilities or other information rights issues;
- *Flexibility of use* – licenses for open source solutions typically confer a more comprehensive set of rights compared to proprietary software. This freedom allows the user to run, change, improve and distribute the software, as required, to meet their needs.

### Implications

- We will undertake a technical review to seek opportunities for the adoption of open source solutions;
- We will energetically consider open source options, as well as proprietary ones, when devising our IT solutions and making procurement decisions;
- Suppliers will be urged to provide proposals incorporating a creative mix of open source and proprietary products to ensure that a best value for money and functionally sound solution is presented;
- As always, it is fundamental that fair and open procurement decisions are made based on the most economically advantageous solution which most effectively satisfies the business and technical requirement;
- Where software is produced in-house, or through publicly funded research and development projects, we will make this available as free open source software for use by other public sector organisations;
- We will review our existing experience and skills base and consider opportunities for up-skilling staff in matters related to open source, particularly within the areas of procurement and legal.
