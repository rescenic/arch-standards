## Open Standards

Use open standards and common government platforms (e.g. SWAN, myaccount) where available.


## Rationale

Benefits of using open standards include:

- *Interoperability & integration* – use of open standards increases the likelihood that solutions provided by different vendors will be capable of interoperating. This can simplify both the integration of multiple applications with a single system as well as increasing the likelihood that different organisations can integrate their systems without the need for additional work. It also increases the likelihood that an off-the-shelf solution can be selected for a particular task, avoiding the need for specially written software;
- *Simpler collaboration* – use of open standards in such projects increases the likelihood that the solution will be generally applicable;
- *Flexibility of use* – use of open standards will provide a more level playing field for open source and proprietary software providers competing for government contracts;
- *Value for money* – The reduced requirement to define, document and test proprietary or bespoke standards will lead to a reduction in the total cost of ownership for solutions;
- *Avoiding lock-in* – successful open standards are readily implemented by a broad variety of software vendors in either open source or proprietary solutions. This reduces the effort and complexity associated with use cases such as transitioning away from a system that is no longer supported or moving from one solution to a competitor that is more cost effective;
- *Transparency* – Open standards will make it easier for the public sector to share data with the public. In particular, non-proprietary formats are a key factor in enabling open data;
- *Sustainability* – Open standards allow large contracts to be broken down into several smaller components. This enables incremental delivery of complex solutions thus reducing risk, as well as providing a more level playing field for SMEs during procurement.


## Implications

- we will adopt and comply with open standards wherever possible, including documenting that compliance for service providers and potential service providers;
- we will maintain ongoing awareness of open standards usage within our estate;
- Relevant open standards will be identified and endorsed using the standards approval process described in the framework; and a catalogue of active open standards will be pro-actively maintained;
-	Open standards will be adopted and compliance to them included in specifications wherever possible;
-	It will be expected that, if there is no material difference in cost for the technology or in its support and maintenance, open standards solutions will be favoured;
-	As always, it is fundamental that fair and open procurement decisions are made based on the most economically advantageous solution which most effectively satisfies the business and technical requirement;
- we  will maintain directly, or indirectly, available skilled resources who understand open standards and the implications of their use in terms of specifying, procuring and maintaining open standards based solutions.
