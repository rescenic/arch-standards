## Continuous Improvement

Build the service incrementally, releasing early and often, using the iterative and user-centred methods set out in the GDS service manual.

### Rationale

Incremental, user-centred and regular improvement of your service through iterations has considerable benefits to the delivery of digital public services, including:

- *Improved visibility*: you can demonstrate progress to your senior stakeholders (e.g. the senior responsible officer, director or deputy director) far earlier in the lifespan of the project or programme;
- *Reduced risk*: releasing regularly avoids creating a 'too-big-to-fail' service that shouldn’t be released, but must be released anyway;
- *Improved quality*: using techniques like test-driven development and automated testing highlights issues with quality early on, when there is still time for them to be addressed;
- *Better value for money*: you can deliver features to your users and stakeholders earlier in the lifespan of the project or programme enhancing the return on your investment;
- *More likely to meet the needs of users*: shorter feedback loops combined with feedback from real users helps to avoid building something that nobody needs or wants;
- *More flexibility*: the delivery team has more opportunities to reflect on progress and then to re-adjust priorities, change direction or even to stop;
- *Improved skills & capability*: the team learns and improves throughout the life of your service delivery.


### Implications

- Review your existing delivery processes and make appropriate changes to ensure that incremental, user-centered delivery is possible;
- Identify and establish appropriate tools and techniques to support iterative delivery early (especially for communication within the team) *and* sustain their usage even once the service is live;
- Identify important metrics, establish a baseline and monitor these for changes throughout the project;
- Ensure that the improvements prioritised for each iteration are traceable the needs of the service's users;
- Employ proportionate governance that is based on clear and measurable goals;
- Prefer "go and see" rather than "wait and hear";
- Focus on managing change and risk in real time rather than at arbitrary points;
- Pro-actively move from a process centred to a human centred governance approach;
- As well as improving your service gradually by talking to your users, talk to your team to keep improving the way they work – for example through retrospectives and stand-ups.
