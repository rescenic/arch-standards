## Data Hosting and Data Centres

### Statement

Adopt cloud computing or virtualisation as the preferred approaches to the delivery of data hosting for the service.

### Rationale

* *Cost savings* - realising this change will reduce the cost of infrastructure, leading to a reduction in the total cost of ownership of digital public services. These savings will be further enhanced by increasing collaborative ICT procurement and by moving to metered, on-demand usage – a 'utility computing' model;
* *Reduced carbon footprint* - a reduction in Scotland’s carbon footprint through the procurement, evaluation and utilisation of data hosting and data centres with proven track records in carbon savings;
* *Hosting agility* - the effort and complexity required to change hosting provider, to operate hybrid infrastructure (on/off premise and public/private) as well as to adjust usage based on prevailing business circumstances will be reduced;
* *Improved service availability* - a move to virtualisation and cloud should deliver enhanced elasticity, resilience and recoverability of the infrastructure required to power digital public services, leading to an increase in availability of these services for citizens.

### Implications

1. Review your current ICT data centre and hosting arrangements;
2. Confirm that the total cost of running data centres and hosting is known;
3. Consider utility and cloud computing in assessing the appropriateness of current arrangements and future investment plans, and ensure that a shift to the cloud takes place when this is the most cost-effective option that delivers business requirements;
4. Considered co-location in existing world class data centres where cloud options cannot meet business needs or are not cost-effective;
5. Avoid building new data centres in order to meet the needs of an individual or small number of organisations with new centres only considered if, in line with principles 3 and 4, cloud or existing data centre options do not meet business needs;
6. Measure and continually improve on you data centre's power usage effectiveness (PUE).
