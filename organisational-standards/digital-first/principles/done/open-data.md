## Open Data

Non-personal, non-commercially sensitive data from public services is a resource for wider societal use and, as such, should be made available for re-use by others.

### Rationale

- Delivery of improved public services through public bodies making use of the data;
- Wider social and economic benefits through innovative use of the data;
- Accountability and transparency in the delivery of our public services;
- Making data that the public sector holds open enables communities and individuals to understand more about public services, gain insight into their own community and contribute to future design and delivery;
- Open data presents an opportunity for citizens to better engage with the public sector regarding both the development of policies and the delivery of public services
- Publishing our data in a reusable form empowers others to use the data for new and exciting purposes;
- Receiving feedback on the data we make open is valuable. Feedback and engagement can:
    - Improve the quality of the data;
    - Private insight into the data;
    - Bring wider groups into the design of public services.

## Implications

- Consider how open data can be built into our information management structure and, therefore, become a part of the standard business process;
- Take a proactive approach to the publication of data, making this the default approach where possible;
- Where new data is to be collected or acquired plan ahead to ensure that it can be made open;
- Publish open data in such away that it is easy to discover, easy to access and easy to process;
- Consider the different audiences who will be accessing the data, their different needs, and design datasets accordingly;
- By default, release open datasets using the Open Government License choosing an alternative license only in appropriate circumstances;
- Provide clear and accurate supporting metadata so that consumers of the data understand what the data is and are aware of any limitations;
- Review the datasets that your enterprise currently owns, identify those that are suitable for publishing, finally, create a plan for publishing this data prioritising high-value datasets;
- Consider the most appropriate location to host your open data sets and plan to register them with the Scottish Data Discovery Site;
- Plan to incrementally improve the quality of open datasets setting a minimum standard of [3 star data](http://5stardata.info);
- Document and realise appropriate governance governance for open data assets, based on the Scottish Government Open Data Strategy;
- Measure the number of datasets made open, the quality of the data (star rating) and, where possible, the number of downloads;
- Provide appropriate training to ensure that staff consider open data implications in their day-to-day work.
