## Green ICT

- [Procurement Reform (Scotland) Act, 2014](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2014/12/contents).

The sustainable procurement duty of The Procurement Reform (Scotland) Act, 2014 refers to the "environment", and requires certain authorities to produce procurement strategies and annual reports. The key element pertinent to the Green ICT strategy is that before carrying out a regulated procurement initiative, public authorities should consider how in conducting the procurement process they can improve the economic, social, and environmental wellbeing of the authority's area.

This is underpinned by self-assessment and prioritisation tools, and a maturity model which will allow procurement staff to assess the behavioural indicators of their organisation, and will feed into the legislative requirement of reporting. These tools should go live in April 2015 with the first requirements for reports to be submitted in 2016, and applies to procurement professionals.
