The Public Services Network (PSN) is a multi-supplier environment providing end-to-end service assurance for security, integrity and reliability, comprising a network of networks operating at a minimum Business Impact Level of IL2 for Confidentiality and Integrity. The PSN in effect offers the benefits of a competitive multi-vendor market place, but with levels of performance and assurance typically associated with a single-supplier network. PSN suppliers must comply with rigorous standards to ensure that this integrity is maintained, and customers who wish to connect to the PSN must for their part comply with a Code of Connection. PSN standards cover service management as well as technical issues such as security, performance, reliability, quality, integrity and interoperability. All suppliers on the PSN Connectivity framework must comply with PSN standards for service management whether or not they are supplying PSN Services.

**Scope**:

PSN Connectivity is a framework agreement consisting of a single lot for procurement of Wide-Area (WAN) connectivity services, including access and core networks and Local Area (LAN) connectivity services.

The following may also be procured through this framework in association with connectivity services:

- Network encryption services
- Network gateways
- Key management
- Consultancy
- Design, deployment, transition and business continuity services
- Implementation and support
- Service integration

Connectivity services typically include:

- Access circuits â copper or fibre including dark fibre
- Leased lines or private circuits, point-to-point or multipoint, Ethernet, SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) or DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing)
- Broadband â ADSL, SDSL (Asymmetric or Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line) or equivalent including LLU (Local Loop Unbundled)
- VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)
- Bandwidths from 2 Megabits per second to 10 Gigabits per second

#### [PSN Services](http://ccs-agreements.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/contracts/rm1498) (RM1498)

The PSN Services framework allows you to purchase services that are compliant with PSN standards. The ten lots under the framework cover a wide range of services.

Connectivity cannot be procured through this framework, with the exception of mobile connectivity, which can be procured through lot 6. The appropriate framework for this is PSN Connectivity (see above).

**Scope**:

- Lot 1 includes the following:
    - Traditional (TDM) Telephony
    - Hybrid Telephony (using Gateways I.E. Q sig converters to allow an evolutionary  approach to IP based solutions)
    - IP-based Telephony systems
    - Call packages (e.g. inbound and outbound voice minutes) and number services such as DDI / premium rate / non-geographic / enquiries
    - Conferencing and collaboration software (including audio-conferencing, desktop videoconferencing, web conferencing, collaboration software
    - Internet, email and website services and integrated messaging / unified communications
    - Hosting and storage
- Lot 2 covers CCTV (including storage, image recognition etc), alarms and remote locking as well as management of CCTV as a service
- Lot 3 covers videoconferencing and telepresence

- Lot 9 covers IL-IL gateways and system-to-system gateways, including internet gateways and remote access services
- Lot 10 allows you to buy any combination of the services available under the other nine lots. This lot has been included for use by customers who are replacing large and highly-integrated network/telecoms contracts rather than as a default route for procurement. This one-stop-shop approach does offer some flexibility. If your requirements include, for example, CCTV, then you can buy those services from a supplier under lot 10 as part of an integrated requirement even though that supplier might not supply them under the specialist CCTV lot. It is likely that keener competitions would be available from the specialist lots.

**Start Date**: 27/06/2012
**End Date**: 26/06/2016

#### [Network Services](http://ccs-agreements.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/contracts/rm1045) (RM1045)
