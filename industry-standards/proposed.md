### [Unicode](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/)

> The Unicode Standard is the universal character encoding standard for written characters and text. It defines a consistent way of encoding multilingual text that enables the exchange of text data internationally and creates the foundation for global software. As the default encoding of HTML and XML, the Unicode Standard provides the underpinning for the World Wide Web and the global business environments of today. Required in new Internet protocols and implemented in all modern operating systems and computer languages such as Java and C#, Unicode is the basis of software that must function all around the world. ~[Unicode Inc.](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch01.pdf)~
