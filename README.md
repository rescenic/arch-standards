# Standards Information Base

A standards information base is an element of an architecture repository that records the standards with which an architecture must comply. It will typically include details of industry standards, shared services and other assets that form part of the mandated delivery context.

This standards information base describes guidance related to the delivery of digital public services within Scotland. For this purpose we elaborate the notion of a standard into the following 4 areas:

- **Policy**          – a set of principles with which all Scottish, public sector organisations must comply;
- **Standards**       – a set of criteria, scoped to a specific program or sector, that must be implemented, unless a specific dispensation is made;
- **Recommendations** – guidance that should be implemented where there is a clear benefit and it is cost effective to do so. This will initially focus on the endorsement of industry / open standards;
- **Guidelines**      – additional and supporting material that organisations could consider if they lack existing capability in the relevant area.
